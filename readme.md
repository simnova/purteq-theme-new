What is Clean?
```

Text:

```
In a world turned sideways, it’s a worthy question to ask.  Is a surface clean if it’s “*sparkling*?”   Is a workplace safe if it seems “*clean and fresh?*”  How long does a “*disinfecting*” wipe-down last?  (Only till the next time it’s touched, right?)  Answering these questions with complete honesty is at the heart of the PURTEQ® promise: At PURTEQ, we create non-toxic, sustainable products that deliver **cleanliness with candor. **
