Is a surface clean if it’s “<em>sparkling<\/em>?”   Is a workplace safe if it seems “*clean and fresh?*”  How long does a “<em>disinfecting<\/em>” wipe-down last?  (Only till the next time it’s touched, right?)  Answering these questions with complete honesty is at the heart of the PURTEQ® promise: At PURTEQ, we create non-toxic, sustainable products that deliver <strong>cleanliness with candor. <\/strong><\/p>"
