All disinfectant products must be registered with the EPA along with scientific proof of their kill claims.<\/p><p>Here’s a good rule of thumb to help distinguish between cleaners and disinfectants: If the product has an EPA number on the label, it’s a disinfectant. No EPA number on the label?  Be safe and only use that product as a cleaner for dirt and grime. <\/p>"

            "answer": "<p>Yes, if the surface is visibly clear of dirt and debris, you only need one step to both clean and disinfect a surface using FRESCH BOTANICAL DISINFECTANT (when used according to disinfection instructions on the label).  If the surface is visibly soiled, we recommend cleaning first (you can use FRESCH to clean, too!).  Once the surface is visibly clear, we recommend spraying FRESCH until the surface is visibly wet and allowing it to dry naturally, no rinse required, even on food contact surfaces to ensure complete surface coverage.<\/p>"

            "answer": "<p>FRESCH has the lowest toxicity rating allowable by the EPA, which means it poses the lowest risk to the health of employees, patients, students, customers, or the environment. FRESCH is tough on germs and bacteria, and non-irritating for users. FRESCH can be used on food contact surfaces without requiring a rinse as it is NSF D2 Registered (No.163429). It can be applied over large areas using a ULV Fogger and provides all the benefits of an EPA-registered disinfectant without containing any harsh chemicals. Its active ingredient is Thymol, a constituent of oil of Thyme. <\/p>"

            "answer": "<p>If you recently switched to CITRAPUR from a different disinfectant, you may notice a residue or stickiness. This is especially common if the last product you used was a quaternary ammonium-based disinfectant – known as a QUAT. After a few cleanings, CITRAPUR should lift and remove the old residue, and there will no longer be a stickiness. If a light layer of residue remains, a quick rinse with water after the listed contact time should resolve this.<\/p>"
